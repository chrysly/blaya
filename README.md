Unofficial one-way Blender -> Maya bridge
## How it works
- A port (Blender Add-On) takes all selected meshes in Blender and exports the scene as an .fbx file.
- The path location of the .fbx file is stored in a .txt file within the local directory.
- In Maya, the user can choose to auto-import the most recently exported .fbx file.
